# House Hosting Plugin

A RuneLite plugin designed to assist players hosting their Player-Owned Houses (POHs).

## Features

*Note: All notifications are fully customizable in the plugin configuration menu. The defaults are good to get started with.*

This plugin provides several key functionalities to help you manage your POH hosting:

### Burner Alarm

Receive notifications before your incense burners extinguish.

* **Two-Stage Alarm:** A pre-warning notification, followed by a final alarm sound.

* **Configurable Lead Time:** Adjust the pre-warning timing.

* **Volume Control:** Customize the final alarm sound volume.

### Unlit Burner Highlight

Easily identify unlit burners.

* **Visual Outline:** Draws a customizable outline around unlit incense burners.

* **Configurable Color & Width:** Choose highlight color and outline thickness.

### Tip Jar Notifications

Get notified when players add coins to your tip jar.

* **Tiered Notifications:** Different notifications and chat recoloring based on tip amount.

* **Configurable Thresholds:** Set custom thresholds for tip tiers.

* **Chat Recolor:** Automatically recolors in-game tip jar messages.

### Player Level-Up Notifications

Get notified when guests achieve level-ups.

* **Generic Level-Up:** Notification for any level-up. This option is disabled by default (it can get pretty spammy). If you decide to use, enable the "Collapse game chat" option in the Chat Filter plugin to condense. 

* **Level 99 Achievement:** Special notifications for level 99.

* **Combat Level 126:** Distinct notification for combat level 126.

### Marrentill Tracker

Monitor your Marrentill supply for altars.

* **Inventory Monitoring:** Tracks unnoted Clean Marrentills.

* **Low Stock Warning:** Notifies you when Marrentill stock is low or depleted.

### POH Guest Tracker

View the number of guests in your house.

* **Overlay Display:** An overlay shows the current guest count in your POH.
